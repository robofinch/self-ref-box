// Note: in below safety comments, "is covariant over" or "is contravariant over" means, more
// precisely, "is sound to covariantly (or contravariantly) cast with respect to". That is,
// manually-proven variance (and manually-proven soundness of casts) is the relevant concern,
// not compiler-assigned variance (and compiler-proven soundness of casts).

// ================================================================
//  fn(T1, .., Tn) -> R    (for argument arities 0..=12)
// ================================================================

// Safety summary:
// - `fn(T1<'varying, .., Tn<'varying>) -> R<'varying>` is covariant over `'varying` if each
//   `Ti<'varying>` is contravariant over `'varying` and `R<'varying>` is covariant over `'varying`.
// - `fn(T1<'varying, .., Tn<'varying>) -> R<'varying>` is contravariant over `'varying` if each
//   `Ti<'varying>` is covariant over `'varying` and `R<'varying>` is contravariant over `'varying`.

// NOTE: for soundness, this macro should not be exported, even just within this crate.
// It assumes that it is used with *this* crate's traits in scope (with the normal names).
// In particular, the `unsafe impl` could be broken in other environments.

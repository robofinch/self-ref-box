// We *could* use the public macros to implement everything besides the function pointer cases,
// but I think it's valuable to show the full `unsafe` code for at least the most crucial cases.

// Note: in below safety comments, "is covariant over" or "is contravariant over" means, more
// precisely, "is sound to covariantly (or contravariantly) cast with respect to". That is,
// manually-proven variance (and manually-proven soundness of casts) is the relevant concern,
// not compiler-assigned variance (and compiler-proven soundness of casts).

//   families are used which implement `UnvaryingFamily`, making them equivalent to `&'a mut U`
//   for some type `U`. Unsafe transmutes aren't even needed.

# Overview

This crate provides [`AliasableView`], [`AliasableViewMut`], and [`CloneableAliasable`] traits
which prohibit certain actions, such as moving a value, from invalidating the temporary "views"
of values implementing the traits.

The traits are intended to be useful for self-referential structs; aliasable source data can be
stored alongside a view to that data (or values derived from views to that data), and so long as
the conditions laid out in the traits are satisfied, the views can be continue to be used
(perhaps via `unsafe` lifetime extension) even when Rust's normal borrow checking and aliasing
rules would ordinarily make such a struct impossible or unsound to implement.

The traits also make use of [`variance-family`] in order to give implementations substantial freedom
over what their view types are; rather than a plain `&'a Self::Target` reference (as with the
`Deref` trait), a view can be an arbitrary type (parameterized by a lifetime, if needed). For
instance, `Option<T>` implements `AliasableView` when `T: AliasableView` by setting
`View<'a, Option<T>>` to `Option<View<'a, T>>`.

# `noalias` Types

`&mut T` and ([currently]) `Box<T>` cannot implement [`AliasableView`] or [`AliasableViewMut`];
with Rust's current `noalias` semantics for those types, moving a value of either of those types
would assert exclusive access over its pointee, which could invalidate views to its pointee.
Therefore, aliasable versions of those types, [`AliasableRefMut<'_, T>`] and [`AliasableBox<T>`],
are provided. Most other common types, including `Vec<T>`, do not assert exclusive access over
data they reference when they are moved. That is [very unlikely to change], but if it ever does,
this crate will have to make a breaking change for the sake of soundness. Conversely, if `Box<T>`
loosens its aliasing requirements, this crate may eventually deprecate and remove `AliasableBox<T>`
in a bump of the major version.

# Prior Art

The [`stable_deref_trait`] crate also offers a trait intended for use with self-referential structs,
but requiring that the reference returned by `Deref::deref` refers to the same address even if the
source value is moved does not seem critical for the soundness of self-referential structs; this
crate's traits more narrowly focus on the properties needed for lifetime transmutes (or lifetime
erasure) of self-references to be sound in self-referential structs.

That does imply, for example, that wacky implementations of [`AliasableViewMut`] that return a new
value from  [`Box::leak`] are considered sound, a `MyString` type may provide "views" of a
source string by cloning it on every call, and a `MyVec<T>` may implement [`AliasableView`] by
using internal mutability to randomly choose which index from which to return a `&T` view. Such
oddities are probably not very useful, but neither do they harm soundness.

(Moreover, the idea of a "stable" deref does not extend well to arbitrary lifetime-infected types.)

The [`aliasable`] crate also provides aliasable versions of `&mut T` and `Box<T>`, but the version
on crates.io at the time of writing is unsound. Therefore, I decided to implement my own
versions (complete with extensive documentation about soundness and aliasing guarantees).

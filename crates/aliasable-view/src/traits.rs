/// # Safety
/// Where the implementor's type is `Self`, the following operations must not invalidate any value

/// below bullet points:
/// - moving a value of type `Self` (or a value formerly of type `Self` that was coerced to a

/// - performing [coercions] on a value of type `Self` that may or may not involve moves,
/// - performing any (sound) operation on a value of type `&Self` (which includes arbitrary
///   operations on data transitively reachable via the `&Self` value).
///
/// Actions with no effect on the source value of a view, including *not* running its destructor
/// (perhaps after moving it into `Box::leak`), are trivially permitted as no-ops. The bullet point
/// for coercions is arguably covered by the bullet point for moves (and this note about no-ops),
/// but it's listed for the sake of caution.
///
/// ## Implications for Users
/// ### Sound usage of a view
/// A returned view can be used at a given moment so long as, starting from when the view
/// was created up to when it is used, only those three operations are performed.
///
/// In particular, a returned view may be soundly lifetime-transmuted from `View<'_, Self>`
/// to `View<'b, Self>` for any lifetime `'b` such that only those three operations are performed
/// on the source `Self` during that lifetime `'b`, and the resulting `View<'b, Self>` can be
/// soundly exposed to arbitrary (sound) code, as the view would remain valid during its entire
/// lifetime.
///
/// Extending a view to a fake lifetime like `'static` may be sound if you are careful to expose
/// that view only to code aware that the lifetime annotation is a lie; in that case, the view
/// should only be accessed when it can be proven that the view was not invalidated.
///
/// Note that the borrow checker would normally force a returned view to remain unused after the
/// source `Self` value is moved. As a result, safe code cannot directly make use of this guarantee;
/// it's most relevant for `unsafe` code. Purely safe Rust can (correctly) assume that a
/// returned `View<'_, Self>` view remains valid during its `'_` lifetime.
///
/// ### Dangers of lifetime-transmuting a view
/// Functions that take owned `Self` arguments or exclusively-borrowed `&mut Self` arguments
/// (or which can transitively access an owned `Self` or `&mut Self`), including [`Drop::drop`],
/// [`mem::drop`], and [`AliasableViewMut::view_mut`], are (in general) allowed to invalidate
/// previously-returned views of those `Self` values (or to enable safe code to later invalidate
/// previously-returned views). Some functions, such as `Box::new` (*when it does not unwind after
/// OOM*) and [`mem::forget`], may be known to only perform permitted operations (possibly only
/// under certain conditions), but be cautious.
///
/// (Note that [`mem::forget`] does deallocate the location of a `Self` value, but a sound
/// implementation of this type cannot hand out views which reference data stored inline in the
/// source `Self`; otherwise, moving a `Self` value could invalidate references in its views.
/// [`mem::forget`] could perhaps be seen as semantically moving the `Self` value to some location
/// that can never be accessed again.)
///
/// As views may have nontrivial destructors, dropping an unsafely lifetime-extended view may
/// count as a usage of that view; if a view is not known to have no drop glue, be careful not to
/// perform any operation that could invalidate a view before dropping it. In particular, drop (or
/// leak) views before dropping the `Self` source of those views.
///
/// For example, when working with panicky functions which only invalidate the `Self` source on
/// error (perhaps by dropping the `Self` value during unwinding), such as `Box::new(self)`, one
/// sound approach is to wrap views in `ManuallyDrop` before calling the panicky function and only
/// unwrap the views after the function's successful return; this ensures that views are not
/// improperly accessed in their destructors during unwinding. A leak is far preferable to UB.
///
/// ## More details for Implementors
/// To elaborate on what is meant by the prohibition against certain operations "invalidating"
/// views, it must be sound to lifetime-extend a `View<'a, Self>` view and continue using it as
/// long as operations on its source `self` value are limited to the three stated cases. It
/// suffices to ensure that (where `'a` is the varying lifetime parameter of [`Self::View`]):
/// - The pointees of pointers in the `View<'a, Self>` view which are assumed to be valid for shared
///   access during `'a`, such as `&'a T` or [`cell::Ref<'a, T>`], are not mutated (except inside
///   [`UnsafeCell`]) or otherwise exclusively accessed by moves or coercions of values of type
///   `Self` (or of formerly-`Self` values coerced to a different type).
///   (This essentially implies that the pointees cannot be stored inline in `Self`; they must
///   either be in static memory, on the heap, in some part of the stack that outlives `Self`, or
///   similar.)
/// - The pointees of pointers in the `View<'a, Self>` view which are assumed to be valid for
///   exclusive access during `'a`, such as `&'a mut T` or [`cell::RefMut<'a, T>`], are not accessed
///   by moves or coercions of values of type `Self` (or of formerly-`Self` values coerced to a
///   different type). (This again implies that the pointees cannot be stored inline in `Self`.)
/// - Exclusive access is not asserted over the pointees of pointers in the view assumed
///   to be valid for accesses during `'a` are not asserted by any of the three operations.
/// - No creative shenanigans are performed in functions that access `&Self` that cause UB when a
///   value of type `Self` is moved or coerced but old views continue to be used.
///
/// The first three requirements are a matter of pointer [provenance], and ensures that the
/// provenance of any pointers or references derived from pointers with a `'a` lifetime in a
/// `View<'a, Self>` view are not shortened, reduced, or removed when the source `Self` is moved
/// or coerced. (The Rust Abstract Machine knows nothing about the stack, heap, or static memory,
/// so they are most pedantically expressed in terms of mutation and accesses, but in practice the
/// first two requirements are about where the pointees are stored.)
/// The fourth requirement ensures that manual checks of invariants that would hold of safe Rust,
/// but not of `unsafe` code utilizing the aliasing guarantees provided by `AliasableView`, are not
/// allowed to trigger undefined behavior.
///
/// The following rough guidelines should be sufficient:
/// - Returning references to data on the heap is sound, *except* for data behind `&mut T` or
///   `Box<T>`. Those two types currently assert exclusive access over their pointees when moved.
///
///   Note that `CString` internally uses `Box<[u8]>`, but most similar `std` types (including,
///   for instance, `String`, `OsString`, and `PathBuf`) internally use `Vec<u8>`, which does
///   *not* currently have stringent aliasing requirements. It would probably be best to avoid
///   `Cow<'a, CStr>` and `CString`, though I am not certain that using them would trigger UB.
// TODO: Miri on Rust Playground doesn't see UB. That may just be because it doesn't recursively
// retag fields. This should be further explored.
/// - Avoid returning references to data that may be on the stack, except for data behind pointers
///   known to outlive `Self`.
///
///   For instance, if `Self` is similar to `&'a T` or [`AliasableRefMut<'a, T>`], then views of
///   `Self` can soundly contain references of lifetime `'a` (or other pointers guaranteed to be
///   valid for lifetime `'a`) to that `T` referenced by `Self`.
/// - Don't check the address of `&Self` to decide whether old views of `Self` should be
///   invalidated. Don't try to detect whether a by-value coercion occurred (which would also
///   move the source `Self`) to decide whether old views of `Self` should be invalidated.
///
/// ### Justification
/// The first three requirements are sufficient to imply that moving or coercing values of type
/// `Self` does not invalidate pointers that are required by this trait to remain valid.
/// In particular, the first two requirements ensure that the pointees of pointers in views are
/// not stored inline in the `Self` value; otherwise, a `Self` and its views stored in local
/// variables on the stack could be returned from a function, causing the views to reference data
/// in a deallocated stack frame. (Such a scenario would assert exclusive access over the pointees
/// and/or be considered to write uninit data to the relevant pointers' pointees; therefore, such
/// a situation is prohibited by the first two requirements.) The third requirement ensures that
/// retags introduced by moving a `&'a mut T` (and, currently, `Box<T>`, among other types) do not
/// invalidate the provenance of views.
///
/// The last remaining threat to the ability to lifetime-extend views and continue accessing them
/// (interspersed with moves, coercions, and shared or immutable access to the source `Self`), is
/// the ability for wacky `&Self` methods to detect whether the source `Self` is moved or coerced
/// and trigger pathological behavior. Note that we do not need to add more general safety
/// conditions prohibiting `&Self` methods from mutating the pointees of shared pointers,
/// accessing the pointees of exclusive pointers, or writing invalid data to their pointees; except
/// in this edge case about manual move or coercion checks, such requirements are already required
/// of all sound Rust code. If a `&Self` method were to invalidate a pointer in a view returned by
/// [`AliasableView::view`] (via mutating or accessing the pointee, or invalidating some transitive
/// invariant of the pointee) when the source `Self` had not been moved, then entirely safe code
/// could obtain a view, call the problematic `&Self` method, and trigger UB by using the old view.
/// It would, however, be sound for a problematic `&Self` method to invalidate a previous view if
/// safe Rust would not be able to access that view, which is the case after `Self` is moved.
/// Some function on the view type could also take a `&Self` argument and choose to manually
/// invalidate a view if its source `Self` was moved. Therefore, for the sake of being absolutely
/// thorough, we explicitly forbid silly edge cases like that.
///
/// Additionally, if `T: AliasableView` and `T` can be coerced to type `U`, then performing the
/// three permitted operations on values of type `U` that had been coerced from type `T` must not
/// invalidate views obtained from `<T as AliasableView>::view`, even if `U: !AliasableView`. The
/// most common way for this to occur is likely `dyn Trait` erasure, which should not be able to
/// cause any problems. It seems unlikely that any problems from coercions could occur accidentally
/// (that is, without intentionally invalidating views as discussed above).
///
/// # Prior Art
///
/// This trait is similar to [`AliasableDeref`], but supporting an arbitrary lifetime-infected
/// type rather than the [`Deref`] trait's `&'_ Self::Target` return type; its intended use case is
/// also similar to that of [`StableDeref`], but the requirement that repeatedly calling `deref`
/// (or `view` in this case) returns the same value is unnecessary for soundness of
/// self-referential types. (Moreover, `StableDeref`'s implementation for `&mut T` [is unsound],
/// and its implementation for `Box<T>` is debatably unsound.)
